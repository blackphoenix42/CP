• You are given a maze with N cells. Each cell may have multiple entry points but not more than one exit (ie. entry/exit points are unidirectional doors like valves).
The cells are named with an integer value from 0 to N-1.
You need to find the the length of the largest cycle in the maze. Return -1 if there are no cycles.


Problem statement: You are given a maze with N cells. Each cell may have multiple entry points but not more than one exit (ie. entry/exit points are unidirectional doors like valves). The cells are named with an integer value from 0 to N-1. You need to find the following :
Nearest meeting cell: Given any two cells - C1,C2, find the closest cell Cm that can be reached from both C1 and C2.
Note: Aim for O(Log(N)) solution.
INPUT FORMAT - First line has the number of cells N
Second line has list of N values of the edge[] array. edge[i] contains the cell number that can be reached from of cell ‘i’ in one step. edge[i] is -1 if the ‘i’th cell doesn’t have an exit.
Third line contains two cell numbers whose nearest meeting cell needs to be found. (return -1 if there is no meeting cell from the two given cells) .
OUTPUT FORMAT - Find nearest meeting cell (NMC).

In a ludo snake game, you have to design an algorithm to reach from 30 to 100 in the minimum number of steps.



graph,detect maximum cycle sum



converging maze ,find the nearest meeting point



I was given 3 questions on trees.First one was to find the lowest common ancestor and the other was to find the node with a maximum weight(max weight defined as the sum of edges of nodes which were incident on that node).



Given two sorted arrays of size m and n+m. Merge them in to 1 single sorted array with out extra space and in o(n) time.

Tree Traversal
 
 
 
-> construct a tree and find depth where maximum no. of nodes are present
-> construct a tree and print it in level order traversal
-> construct a tree and find the nearest common parent node


converging maze
1) largest cycle
2) maximum input point
3) shortest meeting point between 2 nodes.


Find the largest cycle in a given graph



The Question:
Input:
23 (Number of nodes)
4 4 3 13 0 -1 ... 23 values (Edge array.. Edge[i] value indicates the node connected to "i" node. For example. First value E[0] is 4. This means the node with value 0 to connected directly to node with value 4)
9 2 ( Find the node with shortest distance from 9 and 2 )
Output: The node with shortest distance ( Where 9 and 2 can meet )
Second question was to count the number of edges in the graph.
One more question was to find the exit points in the graph for a node. If the next node is -1, It implies an exit.
